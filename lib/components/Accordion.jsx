/**
 * Provides a standard accordion component.
 *
 * This component expects that its children will be {@link AccordionItem}s.
 *
 * Accordion components can be displayed using one of two styles.  The default 
 * style is borderless, where the active content does not have a border around 
 * it.  If a border is desired, you can supply a `type` prop with the value 
 * of `Accordion.TYPE_BORDERED`.
 *
 * Example:
 * <code>
 *   // Borderless accordion
 *   <Accordion>
 *     <AccordionItem ... />
 *   </Accordion>
 *
 *   // Bordered accordion
 *   <Accordion type={Accordion.TYPE_BORDERED}>
 *     <AccordionItem ... />
 *   </Accordion>
 * </code>
 *
 * By default the Accordion will expand the first item.  To prevent this behavior,
 * you can supply the `startCollapsed` prop.
 *
 * Example:
 * <code>
 *   <Accordion startCollapsed>
 *     <AccordionItem ... />
 *   </Accordion>
 * </code>

/**
 * Represents a single item in an Accordion object.
 *
 * Accordion items have two parts.  The first is the header element that is 
 * always displayed.  The second is the content element that is only displayed 
 * if this item is the active one.  The {@link Accordion} class is responsible 
 * for managing which item is active.  When this component is rendered as a 
 * child of the {@link Accordion} class, it will automatically set the 
 * `accordionIndex` and `action` props which indicate which index we are and the 
 * function to call when our header element is clicked to make us the active 
 * item.
 *
 * The header element can be specified in one of two ways.  The first is 
 * to simply supply the `title` prop to have that string rendered as the 
 * header.  In this case, the content should be supplied as the child of 
 * this component.
 *
 * The second way to specify the header is to provide two child elements. In this 
 * case the first will be used as the header, and the second as the content.
 *
 * See the example below for sample code for each method.
 *
 * Example:
 * <code>
 *   <AccordionItem title="First Amendment">
 *     <p>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of ...</p>
 *   </AccordionItem>
 *   <AccordionItem>
 *     <span>First Amendment</span>
 *     <p>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of ...</p>
 *   </AccordionItem>
